  Danny was the one adding the total calculations,filtering and deleting expenses. In addition, Darren was the one who made the repositary, add expenses, and view expenses. The challenges were mostly the time management part as we got sick. Unfortunately, when members fell ill, the progress of the project slowed down and causing delays. To overcome these problems, better planning and communication could have helped, ensuring that even if one person faced issues, the others could step in or adjust timelines. Despite these challenges, collaborative coding can be a rewarding experience when done effectively. It allows for shared knowledge, better problem solving, and improved code quality, though it requires clear communication and proper task distribution to work smoothly.
